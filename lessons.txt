LESSON 1: XHTML
eXtensible HyperText Markup Language. 
The ”x” came from XML or eXtensible Mark-up Language.
Though different from HTML, XHTML also uses the filename extension .html
The content of the actual coding might change because of XHTML conventions but it still holds the same filename extension.
stricter and cleaner version of HTML
Aimed to replace HTML
All new Web browsers support XHTML

LESSON 2: HTML LISTS
used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. 3 types of HTML lists:
Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)
-Data can be presented in enumerated format or list.
-This is the type of list where each item is numbered usually starting at 1 (but can be changed using the start attribute

Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)
-Enumerates each item as bulleted and uses container tag <ul></ul>.
Different types of bullet:
-disc for round bullets
-circle for circular bullets
-square for square bullets

Description List or Definition List/Glossary List (dl)
-The definition list uses the tags <dt></dt> for the item itself and <dd></dd> for the definition of the item.

LESSON 3: HTML TABLES
TABLES:
allow you to organize and arrange data into columns and rows.
allows you to divide your page into sections where you can place headers, footers and navigation links. 
made up of rows and columns
by default has no borders, so you need to have a value of at least 1 for the border attribute.

LESSON 4: HTML TABLES 2
MERGING CELLS HORIZONTALLY:
Cells in the same row can be merged using the colspan attribute of <td></td> and <th></th>

MERGING CELLS VERTICALLY:
Cells in the adjacent row can also be merged using the rowspan attribute of <td></td> and <th></th>

Merging Cells Horizontally and Vertically:
Merged cells on the same row can also be merged with cells on the adjacent rows by combining the rowspan and colspan attributes

NESTING TABLES:
Just like lists, tables can be nested. Web page developers use this technique to enhance even more the layout and structure.

Adding an Image to a Table: 
You can add image to a cell by using the tag pair <td><img src=“…”>

LESSON 5: HYPERLINKS
A reference link that allows you to navigate to another page of the same document or to another document.

THREE TYPES OF HYPERLINKS:
Absolute URL – links to a page on a different Web server
Relative URL – links to a page on the same Web server 
Named Anchor – links to a different location on the same Web page

LESSON 6: HTML FORMS
FORM:
Allows you to gather feedback to provide better service
Purposely designed for gathering information on the Internet. These HTML documents are sent back to the server once the user submits them.
The areas on the form are called fields, text fields or text boxes
FORM ATTRIBUTES:
Action attribute
responsible for indicating where the information will be passed whether it is to another Web page or to a script.
Value = URL
Method attribute
responsible for indicating the way for sending the information
Get: retrieving data
Post: update or stores data

FORM CONTENT:
Should be both visually appealing and functional
Use the container tag “<form></form>” 
Start organizing the form by placing the input empty tag inside the <form> set of tags and have its attribute type specify the kind of input you are going to have.
Another attribute name, distinguishes one input field to another.

INPUT ELEMENT:
used for making text boxes, password boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, submit buttons and reset buttons depending on the value of the type attribute.

LESSON 7: HTML FORMS 2
TEXTBOX:
Textboxes are single line text input boxes.
Textboxes are used for username input and other single line texts.
Can be made by keying in text as the value of the type attribute of the <input>.
You can use the value attribute to set an initial text input.
The size attribute then indicates the length of the textbox.

LARGE TEXT AREA:
You can create an input field that can span several rows and columns
Text areas are made via the container tag <textarea></textarea>.
The content of this tag will be displayed in the text area by default.
Example: <textarea name=“spiderman”> Do you like spiderman?</textarea>

WRAPPING:
Soft word wrapping – wraps the text only in the text area and not when it is submitted.
Hard word wrapping - wraps the text only in the text area and also when it is submitted
Word wrapping can be removed by keying in off as the value for the wrap attribute.

RADIO BUTTONS:
Provide the users a variety of choices where only one can be selected.
Can be made by keying in radio as the value of the type attribute of <input>
Example: <input type=“radio” name=“gender”>
In a set of radio buttons, only one can be chosen
Radio buttons of the same group have similar value for their name attributes
The checked attribute is applicable for radio buttons to indicate a default selected option.
Usually used when the choices are few.

LESSON 8: HTML FORMS 3
CHECK BOXES:
offer users a variety of choices where none, only one or many may be selected.
Can be made by keying in checkbox as the value of the type attribute of <input>
<input type=“checkbox” name=“fav_sanrio”>

DROP-DOWN MENUS:
Offer users a variety of choices where only one can be selected
Made via the container tag <select></select>.
Individual items in drop-down menus are defined by
the container tag <option></option>

EMAIL FEEDBACK FORM
Allows communication with your website’s visitors. Visitors can submit questions and comments which will then be forwarded to your email address.
<form action=“mailto:mitzz.koga0309@mailadd” method=“get” enctype=“text/plain”>

SUBMIT BUTTON
Usually placed at the end of forms and when clicked, submits the information input.
It can be made by keying in submit as the value of the type attribute of <input>

RESET BUTTON
Usually placed at the end of a form.
When it is clicked, it clears all the input information.
This can be done by keying in reset as the value of the type attribute of <input>

ADDING A FILE
Allows your website visitor to send files to your web server.
File can be made by keying file as the value of the type attribute of <input> while the accept attribute specifies the types of files that the server accepts (that can be submitted through a file upload)
<input type=“file” name=“image” accept=“file_extension”>

</body>
