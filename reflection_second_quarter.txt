  <h3>Reflection on the 2nd Quarter</h3>
  <p>
    This second quarter has been a rewarding learning experience. I’ve learned so much, particularly about CSS and web design, which helped me improve my E-Portfolio. Working on projects like **Booklandia**, **Historical Icon**, and the **Cleanest Classroom** competition gave me the chance to apply my skills and showcase my creativity. I enjoyed being part of these activities, as they allowed me to learn through both teamwork and individual effort.
  </p>

  <h3>Booklandia</h3>
  <p>
    Booklandia was a creative project that allowed us to explore storytelling and the importance of books. Through collaboration, we created a fun and interactive book-themed environment. It was a great way to develop teamwork and creativity while learning more about the power of literature.

  <h3>Cleanest Classroom</h3>

    The Cleanest Classroom competition encouraged teamwork and cleanliness. It was a fun and challenging activity that helped us create a positive and tidy learning environment. This project taught me the importance of responsibility and working together as a class.

  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
  <p>
    This quarter, I’ve learned a lot about web design and development. I gained a deeper understanding of CSS, from basic text formatting to more complex layout designs. The lessons on selectors, divs, spans, and links have given me the foundation to build more structured and dynamic webpages. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I also learned about the three layers of a webpage: content, presentation, and behavior. Each of these plays a vital role in how a website functions and looks. Furthermore, the different types of stylesheets—external, internal, and inline—have provided me with various ways to apply styling to my projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving forward, I look forward to diving deeper into more advanced topics in web development and enhancing my skills in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing websites.
