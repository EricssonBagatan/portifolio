My name is Ericsson O. Bagatan, one of the things I love doing is playing badminton with either my father or my sister.<br>
Badminton makes me feel relaxed as when playing it, I forget all the stress I had in school or maybe even schoolworks.<br>
I'm also the youngest in my family! I have 2 sisters, my sister, Ate Star actually studies here at LPSci too!<br>
I also have a dog named Chaplin, he is very stubborn, but I still love him dearly.
