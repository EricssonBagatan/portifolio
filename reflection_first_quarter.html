During the first quarter, I learned a lot from the lessons such as being able to know the difference between XHTML and HTML,adding ordered lists, unordered lists, creating tables to creating forms. <br>
Although the tests we had were hard, it is the reason why I understood the lessons even clearer, the questions during the first and second long test made me understand how the codes worked and how just one error can alter your entire product.<br>
During the first quarter, I realized that websites and even simple webpages take time, patience and full understanding of the topic to make one. <br>
Not only did I learn how to code, but I also learned certain values from our class, one of them is being the virtue of patience, without this virtue, <br>
it's impossible to create a website or webpage that would meet your own criteria as you're always rushing to create the website or webpage. <br>
Another value I learned during our class is the virtue of perseverance, with this virtue, you will be able to overcome any obstacle in your life not just <br>
making webpages or websites.
